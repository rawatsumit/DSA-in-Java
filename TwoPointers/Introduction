Pattern: Two-Pointer Technique (Opposite Ends)

When to use:
Array is sorted (or can be sorted for the solution).
You need to find pairs or triplets that match a certain condition.

Often used for:
Finding a pair with a given sum.
Removing duplicates in-place.
Reversing an array.

How it works:
Start with two pointers:
left at the beginning of the array.
right at the end of the array.
Move pointers toward each other based on the condition:
If the sum is too small, move left rightwards (left++).
If the sum is too large, move right leftwards (right--).
Repeat until left crosses right.
