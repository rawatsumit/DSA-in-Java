Finding sum of digits of a number until sum becomes single digit
Given an integer n, we need to repeatedly find the sum of its digits until the result becomes a single-digit number.

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)

class Solution{
    static int repeatedSumOfDigits(int N){
        // code here
        
        // sum of digits
        int sum = 0;
        
        // while loop to find repeated sum
        while ( N > 0 || sum > 9){
             if(N == 0){
                N = sum;
                sum = 0;
            }
            sum += N % 10;
            N = N /10;
           
        }   
    
        return sum;
    }
}
