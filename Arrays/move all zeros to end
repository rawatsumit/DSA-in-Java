Move all zeros to end
You are given an array arr[] of non-negative integers. Your task is to move all the zeros in the array to the right end while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
The operation must be performed in place, meaning you should not use extra space for another array.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)

class Solution {
     //swap function   
    void swap(int[] arr, int a, int b){
        int temp = arr[a];
        arr[a] = arr[b];
        arr[b] = temp;
    }
    
    void pushZerosToEnd(int[] arr) {
        
        //array length
        int n = arr.length;
        
        //having track of zero element
        int count = 0;
        
        //iterating each element of an Array
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
            //check if any element is non-zero
            if(arr[i] != 0){
                swap(arr, count, i);
                count++;
            }
        }
       
    }
}
